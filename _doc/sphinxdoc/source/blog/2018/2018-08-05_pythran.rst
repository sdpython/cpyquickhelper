    I discovered than :epkg:`Pythran` was now a possible
    backend for :epkg:`Cython`:
    `Pythran as a Numpy backend <https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/userguide/numpy_pythran.html>`_.
    On one benchmark, it increases the speed by 2. I recommend the reading of
    the following article:
    `Optimizing your code with NumPy, Cython, pythran and numba <https://flothesof.github.io/optimizing-python-code-numpy-cython-pythran-numba.html>`_
    which instigates the performance brought by the four
    following tool and gives some hints on how to write
    efficient code with these tools:

    * :epkg:`Cython`: write code as a mix of *Python* and *C*,
      the closer to *C* the code is, the faster it is. It works
      well with :epkg:`numpy`.
    * :epkg:`Pythran`: it is *C* compiler for *Python* code
      as *Cython* is but optimized for numerical computation.
    * :epkg:`nuitka`: another compiler
    * :epkg:`numba`: :epkg:`JIT` or just in time compilation

    The first three tools converts *Python* into *C* code
    and then compiles it. The main issue comes from type inference
    as *C* is a strongly typed language and *Python* is not.
    The inference is not always possible and that explains
    why the generated code is faster if the user specifies
    the type of each variable used in the optimized section.
    :epkg:`numba` relies on :epkg:`llvmlite`. The first execution
    is slower because it includes a compilation based on types
    discovered along the first execution. If the function is called
    a second time with the same type, the program uses the optimized
    version of it.
