    I wanted to test some facts described in the following blog post:
    `Why is it faster to process a sorted array than an unsorted array? <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11227809/why-is-it-faster-to-process-a-sorted-array-than-an-unsorted-array>`_.
    I ended it writing this notebook :ref:`cbenchmarkbranchingrst`
    which compares a couple of implementations of the same computation,
    a dot product.
